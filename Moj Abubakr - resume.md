# Profile #
---

*I'm a Software Engineer from London, specializing in Android development. I have experience leading and working with both in-house and remote agile teams to deliver beautiful, robust, scalable, world class Android applications. I embrace and advocate agile principles and continuous integration culture. I'm also big on architecture and Kotlin and enjoy learning new technologies and ways of working. I'm particularly interested in IoT, game development, AI and machine learning, and learn as much as I can about the subjects in my spare time. I tend to always have a side project going to test, trial and apply new ideas and concepts.*

*I graduated from London South Bank University with a BEng 1st class honours in [Computer Systems & Networks Engineering](https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/courses/course-finder/computer-systems-networks-beng-hons). I've worked with several high profile clients such as Ford, MetOffice and Tesco during my time at The App Business. I've also worked within the restaurants team at Deliveroo. I'm currently contracting, learning more about different domains, teams and ways of working. In the future, I'd be excited to hone my skills as a servant leader and work towards a career in engineering management.*

- Delivered an entire app redesign by implementing the new visual language which required consolidation of the styling and theming architecture to build out reusable, dynamic visual components. This provided consistency, flexibility of usage and a huge reduction of UI technical debt. Led discussions on approach, deployment and roll-out strategies which allowed us to work simultaneously on the visual overhaul without impacting other ongoing work.
- Worked on simplifying the analytics framework by substantially reducing the boilerplate required to implement events, helping improve the developer experience, enforcing code consistency and ultimately increasing code quality.
- Successfully delivered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia app under extremely tight time constraints requiring me to coordinate efforts across multiple disciplines. Concerted efforts were made to over-communicate to ensure transparency and clarity whilst maintaining a high standard of quality throughout delivery of the project.
- Delivered an overhaul to the payments flow to support additional payment methods such as PayPal alongside various UI and UX improvements to simplify the checkout flow.
- Implemented and refined deep-linking across the app.
- Championed agile practices and cross-functional collaboration, allowing the team to deliver higher quality work given improved communication, transparency and stakeholder involvement.
- Worked frequently with other disciplines to mentor, share knowledge and ideate improvements to features, processes and ways of working.

- Actively led various technical discussions, championing simplicity, quality and user need.
- Updated and refactored the app to use the new AndroidX support libraries.
- Mentored other members of the team to help distribute knowledge and up-skill where needed.

Project ended due to client strategy pivot.

- Worked in the restaurants team building the restaurant live orders app which is used by restaurants to accept, reject and view live orders.
- Took an active lead position, engaging with product roadmap, discovery and planning.
- Actively participated in the restaurant software, hardware and deployment strategies.
- Rebuilt the legacy Bluetooth printer code (which is used to print order receipts) into a library written entirely in Kotlin.
- Led development on a WebSocket backed library to provide real-time connection with the backend servers to both eliminate the need for polling and it's associated polling delay. This reduced server load by more than 60%+ and showed new orders to restaurants up to 30 seconds quicker.
- Improved and simplified the feature flagging, variant experimentation and analytics tracking setup, making it easier and quicker to use.
- Other features implemented include Marketplace+ support, code-base modularization to better improve architecture as well as several other product enhancements and features.

I have to say that he is one of the fastest engineers I've seen delivering product work to the spec, while adhering at the same time to the codebase standards and the high code quality that is demanded at Babylon Health. He got on-boarded very quickly and started delivering from the first week. At the same time, he has the best communication skills I've seen to this day. Very thoughtful, interested in improving the product but also interested in improving the project technical infrastructure. Finally, very inclusive and respectful of others."*

[TAB Insights](http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader) | Ryan Loader | Senior Software Engineer @ [The App Business](http://www.theappbusiness.com/) | November 2017 - *"One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring."*
