# Profile #
---

*I'm a Software Engineer from London, specializing in Android development. I have experience leading and working with in-house and remote agile teams to deliver beautiful, robust, scalable, world class Android applications. I embrace and advocate TDD, agile principles and continuous integration culture. I'm also big on architecture and Kotlin and enjoy continuously learning new technologies and ways of working. I'm particularly interested in IoT, AI and machine learning, and learn as much as I can about the subjects in my spare time. I tend to always have a side project going to test, trial and apply new ideas and concepts.*

*I graduated from London South Bank University with a BEng 1st class honours in [Computer Systems & Networks Engineering](https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/courses/course-finder/computer-systems-networks-beng-hons). I've worked with several high profile clients such as Ford, MetOffice and Tesco during my time at The App Business. I've also worked within the restaurants team at Deliveroo. I'm currently contracting, learning more about different domains, teams and ways of working.*

[**TAB Insights**](http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader) - *"One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring."*
