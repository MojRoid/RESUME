I'm particularly interested in AI and machine learning, and learn as much as I can about the subjects in my spare time.*

[**TAB Insights**](http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader) - *"One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was how Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring."*
