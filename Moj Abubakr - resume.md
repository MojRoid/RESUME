I have experience leading and working with both in-house and remote teams to deliver beautiful, high quality working software. I embrace and advocate TDD, agile principles and DevOps/continuous integration culture. I'm also big on functional programming, architecture and Kotlin and enjoy continuously learning new technologies and ways of working. I'm particularly interested in AI and machine learning, and learn as much as I can about the subjects in my spare time.*

[**TAB Insights**](http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader) - *"One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was how Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring."*
