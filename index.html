<h1>Profile</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>I'm a Software Engineer from London, specializing in Android development. I have experience leading and working with both in-house and remote agile teams to deliver beautiful, robust, scalable, world class Android applications. I embrace and advocate agile principles and continuous integration culture. I'm also big on architecture and Kotlin and enjoy learning new technologies and ways of working. I tend to always have a side project going to test, trial and apply new ideas and concepts.</em></p>
<p><em>I graduated from London South Bank University with a BEng 1st class honours in <a href="https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/courses/course-finder/computer-systems-networks-beng-hons">Computer Systems &amp; Networks Engineering</a>. I've worked with several high profile clients such as Ford, MetOffice and Tesco during my time at The App Business. I've also worked within the restaurants team at Deliveroo. I'm currently contracting, learning more about different domains, teams and ways of working. In the future, I'd be excited to hone my skills as a servant leader and work towards a career in engineering management.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mojroid/">LinkedIn Recommendation</a> | Sakis Kaliakoudas | Android Lead @ <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/">Babylon Health</a> | July 2019 - <em>&quot;Moj spent a few months in Babylon Health as an Android engineer working in one of the teams. I have to say that he is one of the fastest engineers I've seen delivering product work to the spec, while adhering at the same time to the codebase standards and the high code quality that is demanded at Babylon Health. He got on-boarded very quickly and started delivering from the first week. At the same time, he has the best communication skills I've seen to this day. Very thoughtful, interested in improving the product but also interested in improving the project technical infrastructure. Finally, very inclusive and respectful of others.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mojroid/">LinkedIn Recommendation</a> | Paul Blundell | Head of Engineering @ <a href="https://novoda.com/">Novoda</a> | January 2019 - <em>&quot;Knowledgable self starter’ is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Moj. I hired Moj as a Android contractor in 2018 after seeing his great portfolio of work, and he completed the two month contract perfectly. Moj's Android platform knowledge made a dramatic difference in the productivity level of our team. Moj would be an asset to any team.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mojroid/">LinkedIn Recommendation</a> | Dennis Simoni | Software Quality Assurance Analyst @ <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk/">Deliveroo</a> | October 2018 - <em>&quot;Moj is a hard working professional Android developer with excellent communication skills, great ideas to help improve products and processes. He has a very analytical mindset and his code which is mainly written in Kotlin or Java is above standards. He has the ability to explain things in a very calm and easy to understand way and has been a great mentor to me and other colleagues. Moj is a developer that I have really enjoyed working with and I would recommend without thinking twice.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader">TAB Insights</a> | Ryan Loader | Senior Software Engineer @ <a href="http://www.theappbusiness.com/">The App Business</a> | November 2017 - <em>&quot;One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring.&quot;</em></p>
