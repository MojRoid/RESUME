# Profile #
---

*I'm a Lead Software Engineer from London, specializing in Android development.*

*I have experience leading and working with both in-house and remote agile teams to deliver beautiful, robust, scalable, world class Android applications. I embrace and advocate agile principles and continuous integration culture. I'm also big on architecture and Kotlin and enjoy learning new technologies and ways of working. I tend to always have a side project going to test, trial and apply new ideas and concepts.*

*I graduated from London South Bank University with a BEng 1st class honours in Computer Systems & Networks Engineering. I've worked with several high profile clients such as Ford, MetOffice and Tesco during my time at The App Business. I've also worked within the restaurants engineering team at Deliveroo. I've contracted for various companies, allowing me to rapidly learn more about different domains, teams and ways of working.*

I have to say that he is one of the fastest engineers I've seen delivering product work to the spec, while adhering at the same time to the codebase standards and the high code quality that is demanded at Babylon Health. He got on-boarded very quickly and started delivering from the first week. At the same time, he has the best communication skills I've seen to this day. Very thoughtful, interested in improving the product but also interested in improving the project technical infrastructure. Finally, very inclusive and respectful of others."*

[TAB Insights](http://www.theappbusiness.com/insights/tab-asks-ryan-loader) | Ryan Loader | Senior Software Engineer @ [The App Business](http://www.theappbusiness.com/) - *"One of our Android devs, Moj, shared an amazing product story - drilling into the detail of what moves a project from good to great. Moj’s story was about how labels are positioned in the Met Office app we built. Two things struck me during that presentation; the first was Moj’s brilliant explanation of complicated algorithms to a largely non-technical audience using just a whiteboard; he obviously had a very strong understanding of the subject matter. The second was the amount of work that went into a feature that no user was ever going to think about, but which improved the experience for everyone. It was a fantastic story I found really inspiring."*
